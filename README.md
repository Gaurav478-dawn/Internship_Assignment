## 1. Project Overview

This project is an **Interactive Analytics & Prediction System** designed to analyze the global spread of COVID-19 and forecast future infection trends using Artificial Intelligence.

The system bridges the gap between **descriptive analytics** (what happened) and **predictive modeling** (what will happen). It provides stakeholders with a fluid dashboard to visualize historical data and uses Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to predict confirmed cases for the upcoming 15 days.

## 2. Key Features

### Global Pandemic Overview
- **Real-time Aggregation:** Displays total Confirmed, Active, Recovered, and Death counts worldwide.
- **Trend Visualization:** Interactive line charts showing the cumulative spread of the virus over time.
- **Top Affected Nations:** A dynamic bar chart ranking the top 10 countries by total caseload.

### Nation-Specific Analysis
- **Granular Filtering:** Allows users to select specific countries (e.g., US, India, Italy) for detailed analysis.
- **Spread Trajectory:** Visualizes the "Active Case" curve to identify waves and peaks.
- **Mortality Rate Analysis:** Tracks the efficiency of healthcare responses by calculating the death-to-case ratio over time.

### AI Prediction (Machine Learning)
- **Model:** Linear Regression (Supervised Learning)
- **Function:** Trains on historical country data to learn the infection rate
- **Output:** Forecasts the trajectory of Confirmed Cases for the next 15 days
- **Visualization:** Plots the predicted trend line against historical data for easy comparison

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Plotly Express, Plotly Graph Objects
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)

## 5. Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites
Ensure **Python 3.7 or higher** is installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Run the Application
Execute the following command to launch the web interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 6. Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- The raw dataset is cleaned, and dates are converted to datetime objects
- A new feature, "Active Cases," is engineered by subtracting Deaths and Recovered cases from Confirmed cases

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The system aggregates daily records to visualize trends
- Mortality rates are calculated dynamically based on user selection

### Predictive Modeling
- The system uses Scikit-Learn to train a Linear Regression model on the chronological progression of cases (Time vs. Confirmed)
- This model extrapolates the trend line for future dates to estimate upcoming caseloads

## 7. Disclaimer

 **Important:** This tool is intended for **educational and analytical purposes**. The predictions generated by the Linear Regression model are based on historical trends and simple linear growth assumptions; they should **not** be used as the sole basis for medical or policy decisions without consulting complex epidemiological models.
